Class/Stringify version 0.001
=============================

Class::Stringify offers an easy solution to the problem of default stringification
in classes with operator overloading.  Simply by inheriting from this class, you'll
never have to see this error ever again:

 Operation `""': no method found, argument in overloaded package...

The current version is the first beta release.
